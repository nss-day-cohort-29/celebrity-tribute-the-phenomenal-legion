                    <p>“The Doll” is one of televised comedy’s master strokes. It’s impossible to outline the Rube Goldberg
                        machine that sets its magic into motion without explaining the entire episode. But there are so many

                    <p> Only three episodes in is where Curb found its calling as a spinner of anti-fantasies, putting Larry
                        through the unthinkable: the faux pas of breaking a lamp at the party of someone you barely know
                        and being asked to leave, then forced to return again to that murder scene because you left your
                        expensive watch. Sure, maybe that wouldn’t be so horrifying on its own if it were you, but it’s Larry
                        David, who wouldn’t take off his shoes in the house like the hosts requested, and gets chewed out
                        loudly and thoroughly by the woman sweeping up the glass from the lamp.

                    <p> Only with this show would a white protagonist uttering the N-word rank at only No. 10 on a list like
                        this, and that’s due to a couple key factors. One, only the Trump presidency has been building to
                        a moment like this for a longer time – when your uproarious rated-R comedy series gets to a sixth
                        season, there are only so many ways you can still shock your audience. We’d been expecting this ever
                        since Larry confessed in the very first season, “I tend to say stupid things to black people sometimes,”
                        and taking in a displaced African-American family via Hurricane Katrina called the Blacks for the
                        Season Six arc was basically circling the wagons.
