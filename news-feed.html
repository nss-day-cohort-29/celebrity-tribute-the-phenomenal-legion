                        <a href=""><h3>FORGETTING HIS LINES IN THE PRODUCERS</h3></a>
                            <p>It’s not nearly as original as, say, the extended gags about children’s genitalia, but the entire fourth season of Curb was building up to the moment that Larry fucks up onstage in front of an audience as Max Bialystock in The Producers. In fact, it’s kind of the most ordinary public-shaming phobia the show has ever given us. That doesn’t make it any easier to watch a Broadway lead forget his lines onstage in front of all his loved ones and plenty of others. But even then, there’s a chance you’d keep your marbles together better than our Larry, who beckons David Schwimmer to feel his cheek (“It’s like a tushy cheek”) and even gets helped with his lines while inflating his cheek and “popping” it with his hand. It’s a downright live-action Peter Griffin performance. Then again, Mr. David gets the last laugh, foiling a surprise twist by Mel Brooks in a finale that mirrors the central plot of The Producers itself. Still, that minute or two of total uncertainty of what Larry is going to do to get out of this one is as slow-paced and awkward as television ever gets.</p>
