                    <p class="newsfeed-p">Well this is prettay, prettay, prettay good news: Filming has finally begun on “Curb Your Enthusiasm”
                        Season 10.David’s comedy was renewed for a tenth season by HBO last December, with production set
                        to begin in spring 2018 and a yet-to-be-determined debut date yet given. Obviously, something stalled
                        filming for a bit, but hopefully that doesn’t mean you’ll be waiting six years for another season
                        of “Curb” again."We are thrilled that Larry will be back with his uniquely acerbic wit and comedic
                        sensibility,” HBO Programming president Casey Bloys said at the time, with David adding: “As I’ve
                        said many times, when one has the opportunity to annoy someone, one should do so.” “Curb Your Enthusiasm”
                        was created by David, who executive produces and stars on the show. Jeff Garlin and Jeff Schaffer
                        are also executive producers....

                    <p class="newsfeed-p">“The Doll” is one of televised comedy’s master strokes. It’s impossible to outline the Rube Goldberg
                        machine that sets its magic into motion without explaining the entire episode. But there are so many
                        things that must be mentioned, so many people to thank for blessing us with it: There’s the woman
                        who insists Larry throw out his water before entering a theater, even though she doesn’t work there.
                        There’s the sequence upstairs in the ABC executive’s home that can only be watched through one’s
                        hands, rivaling Larry’s other disturbing stumbles involving children too young to know better (even
                        if the girl in this episode seems like a legit sociopath-in-bloom and her mother a deluded enabler).
                        There’s Larry’s own repeatedly creepy comments about the girl’s doll he inevitably has to replace,
                        and its head that inevitably winds up in his pants, and the rash that inevitably makes it look like
                        he’s masturbating. And finally, there’s that button ending you wouldn’t wish on anyone, even a schmuck
                        like Larry David.

                    <p class="newsfeed-p"> Seinfeld, the show about nothing, remains one of the most celebrated shows in television history. Any
                        die-hard fan knows about being sponge-worthy, having man hands, and the epic summer of George. But
                        there was much more to learn about the comedy classic. So we did a little digging and yada, yada,
                        yada ... these are some of the show secrets we managed to uncover.

                    <p class="newsfeed-p"> Only three episodes in is where Curb found its calling as a spinner of anti-fantasies, putting Larry
                        through the unthinkable: the faux pas of breaking a lamp at the party of someone you barely know
                        and being asked to leave, then forced to return again to that murder scene because you left your
                        expensive watch. Sure, maybe that wouldn’t be so horrifying on its own if it were you, but it’s Larry
                        David, who wouldn’t take off his shoes in the house like the hosts requested, and gets chewed out
                        loudly and thoroughly by the woman sweeping up the glass from the lamp.
